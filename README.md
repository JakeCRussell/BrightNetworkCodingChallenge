# BrightNetworkCodingChallenge
My submission for the Google work sample from the BrightNetwork internship experience UK.

I haven't completed every task, and I'm not even sure if the tests pass for the parts I have done (I was unable to get CMake and CTest on my computer) I completed task 1, and every input works as it should, but running the test file in Visual Studio says 16 of them fail, even though the program outputs exactly what the task document says it should.

I fancied a challenge and tried using C++, a language I've never used before, to attempt this. Given that, the limited time, and being out of practice anyway, I am pretty happy with getting as far as I did.

I am incredibly greatful for the opportunity to participate in the BrightNetwork internship experience on demand, and very much appreciate all the effort that went in to making the experience what it was. A huge thank you to everyone who took part.
